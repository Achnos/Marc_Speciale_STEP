We observe digital saturation, as described in section \ref {sect:digsat}. There were errors in the measurement sequence of the $40s, 50s$ and $60s$ exposures. These data points were omitted in the analysis. This was due to all of the lights having been turned on in the room by accident, during the acquisition of those data points}{figure.3.34}{}}
